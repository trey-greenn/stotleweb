I want to become a 0.001% Software Engineer - Comupter Scientist. I currently have a Software Engineering job. Have multiple sideprojects buliding digital apps. Combine this with the desire to master abstract coding technique and concept like, 8090 Top Coder Challenge: The Need for speed, Scott Wu - Devin AI founder, or a top Leet Coder.

Tech I want to master in the next 100/14 Weeks: React/Next JS, TypeScript, Python, C++, Machine Learning, Data Structures and Algorithims, Software Engineering.

Come up with a 14 week study plan where I can master my desired interest. Come from a perspective of this is a semester of self learning. Where I need to test my self and have a final or like last project that encompasses all of the interest. What should my weekly schedule and focus be like for the next 14 weeks.
